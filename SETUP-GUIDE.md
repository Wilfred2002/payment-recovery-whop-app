## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Create the `creator_settings` Table in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the SQL file: `supabase-migration-creator-settings.sql`

```sql
-- The file is located at: /Users/wilfrednaraga/whop-app/supabase-migration-creator-settings.sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents into Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

This will create:
- `creator_settings` table with email configuration
- Indexes for performance
- Trigger to auto-update `updated_at` timestamp

### Step 2: Verify Tables Exist

Run this query in Supabase to verify both tables:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('failed_payments', 'creator_settings');
```

You should see both tables listed.
